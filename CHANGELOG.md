# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- bbe48e4: Add `/prices/history` endpoint backed by 1-minute price snapshots. A new `price_snapshots` table is appended to every minute by a snapshot ingester, queryable over a `[from, to]` window with optional `5m`/`1h` aggregation. A retention job prunes snapshots older than 30 days.

### Patch Changes

- 5a68745: Adopt changesets for versioning and release notes. Adds `@changesets/cli`, a release GitHub Actions workflow that opens a "Version Packages" PR for pending changesets and tags releases on merge, and contributor docs for the workflow.

All notable changes to Lens are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

- BullMQ blocking startup — wrapped in try/catch, ingesters auto-restart
